    <string name="history_sleep_phases_information_deep">The deep sleep phase is of particular importance for the recovery of the body and mind. This is achieved by a very high level of physical and mental relaxation. The body reacts to this phase with a further reduction in breathing and heart rate, the body temperature decreases and the blood pressure falls. No eye movements can be detected during this phase.  In the deep sleep phase, the regeneration and repair of cells takes place and the immune system is extremely active.</string>
    <string name="history_sleep_phases_information_rem">The dream phase is expressed by rapid eye movements under closed eyelids. In addition, both the breathing frequency and the depth of breathing increase. In addition to processing information and emotional sensory impressions, daily events are linked to the long-term memory. To allow this process to run as undisturbed as possible, all external sensory impressions are largely blocked out. As a result, waking up in this phase is extremely difficult. The dreams experienced in this phase are most often remembered after waking up.</string>
