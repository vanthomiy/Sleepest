# LifecycleService Demo 
Demo to show the usage of lifecycle service. Using stop watch timer as an example. As the timer gets started, there will be a foreground service which shows a notification with a current timer. I have used singleton pattern approach for service in order to observe live data values which is inside the service. 

## Communication Flow
Activity/Fragment communicates with TimerService by sending commands as actions like START and STOP service and depending on the action timer service starts to 
perform business logic and push their values to livedata. Those livedata properties are observed by MainActivity.
Here we are using two livedata properties. 
One is for observing time in milli seconds and the second one is to observer TimerEvent which has START and STOP events. Mainactivity observes them and it changes the UI according to the received event.
Livedata properties are available through TimerService companion object.

## Advantages
I felt like this is pretty clean and you can avoid binding our activity to our main activity because our job perfectly suits this scenario.
Due to livedata we don't need to worry about configuration changes like screen rotation.
